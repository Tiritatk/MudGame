# CHANNEL MUD GAME ADD IMAGE
A Roguelike game based on Channel Mud's characters (In development)

## Summary
I started this game in July, 2023, as a suprise for the Channel Mud community, obviously I didn't finish the game just for that, but it's a very nice-looking game for me, and one of my best projects so far, so I want to finish it. I started working on the game the next week after showing a Dev Beta to Channel Mud, but I stopped working. Now it's the time to continue developing this game. I will need to update some logos, but it's not a lot of work. I will be updating the beta with new features every 30 days, adding to a file everything I added.

## Basic info of the game:
* This videogame uses the **Unity Game** Engine _(v20XX.X)_
  * You will be able to create mods
  * I will sharing all the process on Unity

## Release Date:

The Game is still at a very starting point, I can't provide a release date soon.
  
## Credit info:
* All the sprites and the project of the game is being developed by [me](https://github.com/tiritatk) and [SergiXY_](https://github.com/sergixy_).
* I used Aseprite to port the idea of a channel mud ninja in low poly, to an actual low poly style sprite. I also updated the colors of the 3 characters to more vibrant ones (Add photo)
